# Elephant Hormone Analysis Using Machine Learning

This project investigates the relationships between hormonal levels (Prolactin, Cortisol, and Progesterone) in elephants using machine learning techniques. The primary goal is to uncover patterns, correlations, and predictive insights to aid in understanding the physiological and reproductive processes in elephants.

## Introduction
Understanding hormonal fluctuations in elephants is crucial for studying their stress and reproductive health. This project uses real-world data and machine learning techniques to analyze and model the interplay between hormones.

---

## Project Workflow
1. **Domain Understanding**:
   - Analyze the problem domain and its challenges.
   - Define key features and assumptions.

2. **Data Preparation**:
   - Load and preprocess data.
   - Handle missing values and simplify datasets.
   - Generate summary statistics, covariance, and correlation matrices.

3. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Suggest or create new features based on patterns.
   - Match KDD goals with appropriate data mining methods.

4. **Model Development**:
   - Build supervised learning models (e.g., regression, classification).
   - Evaluate models using performance metrics to determine the best fit.
